# LeJOS NXT Drivers

This repository is extracted from the [LeJOS](http://www.lejos.org/) project [repository](https://github.com/cmorty/lejos/). It can serve as a basis to port other software projects to the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT brick, such as [Pybricks MicroPython](https://github.com/pybricks/pybricks-micropython).

The same [LICENSE](./LICENSE) as the original project applies. All credit goes to the original LeJOS developers and contributors. This repository aims to preserve the original history accordingly.

You can run custom NXT firmwares in different ways, such as from flash, RAM, or in conjunction with an NXT bios. This repository focuses only on stand-alone firmware that runs from flash. See the original LeJOS project and [nxtOSEK](http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net/) for other approaches to porting and developing code and apps.
